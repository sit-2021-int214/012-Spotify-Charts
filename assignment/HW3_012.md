# Assignment 3 (Group): Explore Data with dpylr

From week 4 that you have using `dpylr` packages and learn from self learning activity. I want you to review and improvement your group assigment #2. Rewrite your function by using `dpylr` at least 5 topics (from 2 datasets). Your group can add new topics to reach 5 topics.

## Answer

1.) From cats, the maximum of body weight of female cats is 3 kg. and the number of female cats is 47.
```R
cats %>% filter(Sex == 'F') %>% summarise(max(Bwt))
cats %>% filter(Sex == 'F') %>% count()
```

2.) From cats, can show the frequency of each body weight values likes below.
```R
cats %>% count(Bwt)
```

3.) From the survey, the value of 'Age' that has the most frequency or called Mode is 17.5 with 13 students.
```R
table(survey$Age)
Mode(survey$Age)
#[1] 17.5
#attr(,"freq")
#[1] 13
```

4.) From the survey, the average of all 'Height' values of students is 172.3809 cm.
```R
mean(survey$Height,na.rm = TRUE)
#[1] 172.3809
```

5.) From the survey, the median of students' hand span length is 18.5 cm.
```R
survey %>% filter(!is.na(Wr.Hnd)) %>% summarise(Wr.Hnd_median = median(Wr.Hnd))
```

6.) From the survey, 16.5% of students clap their hands with the left hand on top.
```R
survey %>% group_by(Clap) %>% summarise(percent = n() / count(survey) * 100) %>%
  filter(Clap == 'Left')
```

7.) From the survey, 115 students have body height more that average height of all students
```R
avg_height <- mean(survey$Height, na.rm = TRUE) # 172.3809
length(which(avg_height > survey$Height)) # 115
```

8.) From the survey, the difference of males pulse and females pulse is 8.4% from all of population pulse rate
```R
males_pulse <- mean(which(survey$Sex == 'Male'), na.rm = TRUE) # 108.9322
females_pulse <- mean(which(survey$Sex == 'Female'), na.rm = TRUE) # 128.9153
pulses <- (males_pulse + females_pulse) # 237.8475
diff_pulses <- abs(males_pulse - females_pulse) # 19.98305
round((diff_pulses / pulses) * 100, digits = 2) # 8.4
```

9.) From cats, can show the frequency of each heart weight values likes below.
```R 
summary(factor(cats$Hwt))
```

10.) From survey,can show sex, age of the student and who smoke with heavy level.
```R
table(survey$Sex,survey$Age,factor(survey$Smoke == "Heavy"))
```
