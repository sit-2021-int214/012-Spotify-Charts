# Assignment 3 (Group): Explore Data with dpylr

From week 4 that you have using `dpylr` packages and learn from self learning activity. I want you to review and improvement your group assigment #2. Rewrite your function by using `dpylr` at least 5 topics (from 2 datasets). Your group can add new topics to reach 5 topics.

## Answer

1.) From cats, the maximum of body weight of female cats is 3 kg. and the number of female cats is 47.
```R
cats %>% filter(Sex == 'F') %>% summarise(max(Bwt))
cats %>% filter(Sex == 'F') %>% count()
```

2.) From cats, can show the frequency of each body weight values likes below.
```R
cats %>% count(Bwt)
```

3.) From the survey, the value of 'Age' that has the most frequency or called Mode is 17.5 with 13 students.
```R
head((survey %>% group_by(Age) %>% summarise(freq = n()) %>% arrange(desc(freq))),1)
# A tibble: 1 x 2
#     Age  freq
#   <dbl> <int>
# 1  17.5    13
```

4.) From the survey, the average of all 'Height' values of students is 172.3809 cm.
```R
survey %>% summarise(Height = mean(Height,na.rm=TRUE))
#     Height
# 1 172.3809
```

5.) From the survey, the median of students' hand span length is 18.5 cm.
```R
survey %>% filter(!is.na(Wr.Hnd)) %>% summarise(Wr.Hnd_median = median(Wr.Hnd))
```

6.) From the survey, 16.5% of students clap their hands with the left hand on top.
```R
survey %>% group_by(Clap) %>% summarise(percent = n() / count(survey) * 100) %>%
  filter(Clap == 'Left')
```

7.) From the survey, 115 students have body height more that average height of all students
```R
survey %>% summarise(avg_height = mean(Height,na.rm=TRUE))
length(which(avg_height$Height > survey$Height))
```

8.) From the survey, the difference of males pulse and females pulse is 8.4% from all of population pulse rate
```R
survey %>% filter(Sex == 'Male') %>% summarise(males_pulse = mean(Pulse, na.rm = TRUE))
survey %>% filter(Sex == 'Female') %>% summarise(females_pulse = mean(Pulse, na.rm = TRUE))
pulses <- (males_pulse + females_pulse)
diff_pulses <- abs(males_pulse - females_pulse)
round((diff_pulses / pulses) * 100, digits = 2)
```

9.) From cats, can show the frequency of each heart weight values likes below.
```R 
cats %>% count(Hwt)
```

10.) From survey,can show sex, age of the student and who smoke with heavy level.
```R
survey %>% select(Sex,Age,Smoke) %>% filter(Smoke == 'Heavy')
```
