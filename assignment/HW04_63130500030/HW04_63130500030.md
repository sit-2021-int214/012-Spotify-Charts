## Part 1 : Explore the dataset

```r
# Install a package for first time
install.packages("DescTools")
install.packages("assertive")
install.packages("magrittr")
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Import libraries
library(DescTools)
library(assertive)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)

# Import Dataset
prog_books_org <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/prog_book.csv")

# Change to tibble new one to confirm, and seperate from original
top_prog_books <- as_tibble(prog_books_org)
```

### For observation the dataset
```r
glimpse(top_prog_books)
```
**Result:**
```

```

After obverse in this dataset, can see that there are 271 observations and 7 variables by 2 double variables (Rating,Price), 1 integer variable (Number_Of_Pages), 4 character variables (Reviews,Book_title,Description,Type). So, each variable can explain as below...

`Rating`: The user rating for the book. the rating score ranges between 0 and 5.\
`Reviews`: The number of reviews found on this book.\
`Book_title`: The name of the book.\
`Description`: a short description of the book.\
`Number_Of_Pages`: Number of pages in the book.\
`Type`: The type of the book meaning is it a hardcover book or an ebook or a kindle book etc.\
`Price`: The average price of the book in USD where the average is calculated according the 5 web sources.

That is incorrect with variables named `Reviews` which should be numeric and `Type` which should change to factor for any computing conveniently after. However, for 'Kindle Edition' type, like 'ebook' type which must read through Kindle, one of all Amazon Apps, also must move it into ebook type instead that seems one together with.

Then will have changed and shown in the part of `Transform data and finding insight the data` after this.

## Part 2 : Transform data and finding insight the data

### Check duplicate book title (with stringr functions)
```r
top_prog_books %>% duplicated() %>% sum() > 0
```
**Result:**
```
[1] FALSE
```
From checking, not found any duplicate book title in this data.

### Change data type

#### Reviews: character -> numeric 
```r
top_prog_books$Reviews <-
  top_prog_books$Reviews %>% str_trim() %>% str_squish() %>% str_remove(",") %>% as.numeric()
```
**Explanation:**\
`str_trim()` : removes whitespace from start and end of string then has uesd before change data type.\
`str_squish()` : reduces repeated whitespace inside a string then has uesd before change data type.\
`str_remove(pattern)` : remove matched patterns in a string as example above then has uesd before change data type.

#### Type: character -> factor
```r
top_prog_books <-
  top_prog_books %>% mutate(Type = as.factor(Type))
```
**Explanation:**
`mutate` : adds new variables and preserves existing ones.

### Write to CSV for keeping the changes before finding insight
```r
write_csv(top_prog_books, "top-prog-books-cleaned.csv")
```
### Summary
```r
summary(top_prog_books)
```
**Result:**
```

### Finding insight the data

#### 1. What the Computer Science / Programming books which are the highest rating books ?
```r
# Seperate the highest rating books from all the data
highest_rating_books <- top_prog_books %>% filter(Rating == 5.00)
# To show the highest rating books and its data 
str_glue_data(highest_rating_books,
  "{Book_title}\nPrice: ${Price}\nType: {Type}\nThere is a description likes:\n{Description}")
```
**Result:**
```r
Your First App: Node.js
Price: $25.85588235
Type: ebook
There is a description likes:
A tutorial for real-world application development using Node.js, AngularJS, Express and MongoDB

Published via Leanpub, and can be found here: https://leanpub.com/yfa-nodejs

In this book, you will learn the basics of designing and developing a node.js application. Unlike other books, focus here is on learning multiple technologies at once and defining processes for success. T



...more
```
**Explanation:** Use `stringr` function named `str_glue_data` to link each value in a row to the long message be a string that's more convenient than open all its view when must read the summary or observe with small group data. From above, appears that 'Your First App: Node.js' is the Computer Science or Programming book which's the highest rating book without comparison about the number of reviews with others.


#### 2. What is the maximum and minimum price each book type ? 
```r
top_prog_books %>% group_by(Type) %>%
  summarise(max_price=max(Price),min_price=min(Price)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(max_price))
```
**Result:**
```
# A tibble: 6 x 3

6 Unknown Binding            38.3     36.1

**Explanation:** The top 10 books that are the cheapest together with the number of reviews and rating, most type are 'Hardcover' again but most number of reviews each books are more than 1200.


## Part 3 : Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) Graph show a relation in the group of books which rating are equal to or more than 4 and number of pages are less then 1000 between the number of pages and the number of reviews.
```r
top_books_rating_4to5 <- top_prog_books %>% 
  filter(Rating >= 4 & Number_Of_Pages < 1000) %>% arrange(desc(Rating))
num_pages_reviews_plot <- ggplot(top_books_rating_4to5,aes(y=Reviews,x=Number_Of_Pages))
num_pages_reviews_plot+geom_jitter()+ggtitle("Relation between the number of pages and the number of reviews")
```
Result:
![num_pages_reviews_plot](num_pages_reviews_plot.png)

### 2.) Graph show the number of pages each book by separating `Type` with colors.
```r
num_pages_each_book_plot <-
  ggplot(top_prog_books,aes(x=Book_title,y=Number_Of_Pages))+geom_point(aes(color=Type))
num_pages_each_book_plot+ggtitle("The number of pages each book by separating type")+ylab("The Number of Pages")+xlab("Book Names")
```
Result:
![num_pages_each_book_plot](num_pages_each_book_plot.png)
